<li> <B>Simplified Income-Stream Planning Tool</B> or <B>SIPT</B> - 
Calculate a personal finance Glide-Path of Cash-flows from yearly Income Streams, Expenses, Investment Accounts and Taxes. This spreadsheet estimates yearly income from various sources: Work, Social Security, Pensions, Annuities, and Insurance; contributions and withdrawals from tax-deferred IRAs, Roths and Savings investment accounts; and withdrawals for Estimated Expenses are done on a yearly cash-flow basis. Contributions, withdrawals and estimated expenses can be either <b>scheduled</b> (i.e., periodic) or <b>irregular</b> (e.g., trip around the world, new house, new car, etc.), or both. The spreadsheet then estimates yearly federal tax rates, cash flows, and investment account balances. The results are presented as tables and glide-path graphs.	
<p>

To use the spreadsheet, just enter your data in the <b><font color="red">red</font></b> cells in the data entry worksheets. The first and second versions of the spreadsheet contain <b>demonstration</b> data including examples of all types of income sources. The full <i>Demo</i> version also contains irregular contribution / withdrawal / expenses / deductions to illustrate the types of data that could be entered. The second, <i>noIrregularDemo</I>, version is the same as the full Demo version but without any irregular data. The third version, <i>noDemo</i>, has no demonstration data and may be the easiest to edit. You might review the

initial worksheet that describes how to use the spreadsheet. The three distributions of the spreadsheet are listed below. Click on one of the three hyperlinks below to download it. To edit and save your 	data, your version of Excel on your computer may require you to click on "Enable Editing" if it says "Protected View" at the top of the screen.

<B>SUMMARY:</B> 
			
This Excel spreadsheet is a planning tool for people who want to plan for future saving and spending needs, want to get rough estimates of their saving and spending patterns, and are willing to enter summaries of their personal financial data  required to compute this.  Final results are shown in summary tables and glide-path  graphs of those tables. All data is entered  and calculated in this spreadsheet. No data is exported from the spreadsheet. From the data that you enter, the spreadsheet estimates yearly cash-flows using income from various sources: Work,  Pensions, Social Security, Annuities, and Life Insurance benefits;  contributions and  withdrawals from tax-deferred IRAs, Roths and Savings investment accounts. It also estimates yearly expenses. It then estimates yearly Federal tax rates and resulting cash-flows. It allows scheduled and irregular contributions and withdrawals for investment accounts (IRA, Roth, Savings) as well as scheduled-and-irregular expenses and deductions. It then estimates investment returns and taxes on investment returns. These are also used in the calculations for estimating yearly net worth. It can be useful for investigating various planning scenarios by making changes and seeing how that affects the results. It will run in a variety of spreadsheet programs such as Windows Excel, OpenOffice or LibreOffice "calc", Google"sheet", etc. since it doesn't use Microsoft Visual Basic because VBA may not be available in all spreadsheet programs. It does not save data on the Internet. Why model? Although all models will be inaccurate, having a rough estimate can be useful for planning purposes. The spreadsheet is a compromise between complexity and completeness and leans in the direction of a simpler model. It is an educational tool. As statistician George Box noted "All models are wrong, but some are useful". In addition, a crude glide-path calculator is available to illustrate the concept that may be useful to experiment with to better understand the concept of glide-path before using the full spreadsheet.


<p>					
<B>STATUS:</B> Fixed data option bug in TaxData. Added ROR overide in SavingsData. Cleaned up the Social Security calculation and description to show the delayed claim benefit and the additional CPI added on with SS COLA. Added Cash Rate Of Return (ROR) to SavingsData to better estimate savings portfolios ROR. Added a  "virtual" deductible IRA computed as the asset weighted values for: 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), traditional-IRA, Rollover IRA to computes the average characteristics s for the virtual deductible IRA. Added IRS pub 590-B Single Life Expectancy Table used by lifetime IRA for other than age 70 1/2 RMD. Added Table-GUIs to allow multiple entries for Insurance (in AgeData worksheet), Work history, different types of deductible-IRAs (deductible, inherited-5yr, inherited-lifetime), and Roth-IRAs (non-deductible Roth, inherited-5yr, inherited-lifetime, Roth-401(k)). Improved Results worksheet including new tables, added Glide-Path graphs for some of the tables. Improved and simplified the SimpleCalc including optional Social Security income annuity. Updated the screen shots in the Figures worksheet. Updated documentation throughout including Resources, Glossary and FAQ.

- is an elementary retirement glide-path analysis that lets you look at your finances over time. You enter a few parameters and it computes and a table of savings which is also plotted as is shown in the  screen shot. When you retire, it subtracts an inflation adjusted percentage of your earlier income and estimates when you run out of money. It will add your Social Security annuity income when you retire and stop your work income. This spreadsheet is the same as the <i>SimpleCalc</i> worksheet included in the SIPT spreadsheet above and is offered as separate spreadsheet for convenience. Enter your data in <b><font color="red">red</font></b> cells overwriting the existing demonstration data.<br>

- This spreadsheet estimates how much your invested assets are worth as spendable assets (i.e. after taxes). You can estimate this three ways: 1) if the assets are sold slowly over a lifetime; 2) you may optionally sell some of your assets from your taxable investment, tax-deferred IRA or Defined Contribution (DC) plan (above the RMD amount) accounts; and alternatively, 3) you can liquidate all of your assets in one year putting you into a higher tax bracket. To use, just enter your data in the  <b><font color="red">red</font></b> cells overwriting the existing demonstration data. <br>

<b>Disclaimer:</b> This software attempts to compute various personal finance estimates using simplified models. No claim is made to the accuracy, suitability, and correctness of the algorithms. Also, note that the further out one goes overtime, the less accurate any estimates will be. Since the software uses static models and static rates of return, CPI, etc. that you enter, it will not track actual values over time. The software	uses only Excel formulas and <I>does not use Visual Basic (VBA)</I>, so you can easily review all computations if you desire. Because it uses generic spreadsheet coding (with no VBA), it will run in a variety of spreadsheet programs such as Windows Excel, OpenOffice or LibreOffice "calc", Google"sheet", etc. <B><FONT color="red">Use this software at your own discretion and risk</FONT></B> as an initial way to think about some personal finance problems. There is no warrantee for this software and no responsibility is taken for any errors in or your use of the spreadsheet. This is educational software.

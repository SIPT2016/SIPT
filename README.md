<li> <B>Simplified Income-Stream Planning Tool</B> or <B>SIPT</B> - 
      Calculate Glide-Path from yearly Cash-flows, Income Streams, Expenses, Investment 
			Accounts and Taxes. This spreadsheet estimates yearly income from various sources: Work, 
			Social Security, Pensions,Annuities, and Insurance; contributions and withdrawals from 
			tax-deferred IRAs, Roths and Savings investment accounts; and withdrawals 
			for Estimated Expenses are done on a yearly cash-flow basis. Contributions, 
			withdrawals and estimated expenses can be either <b>scheduled</b> (i.e., 
			periodic) or <b>irregular</b> (e.g., trip around the world, new house, new 
			car, etc.), or both. The spreadsheet then estimates yearly federal tax rates, 
			cash flows, and investment account account balances. The results are presented
			as tables and glide-path graphs.			
			To use it, just enter your data in the <b><font color="red">red</font></b> cells 
			in the data entry worksheets. The first and second versions of the spreadsheet 
			contain <b>demonstration</b> data including examples of all types of income 
			sources. The full, Demo, version also contains irregular contribution / 
			withdrawal / expenses / deductions to illustrate	the types of data that 
			could be entered. The second, noIrregularDemo, version is the same as the 
			full Demo version but without any irregular data. The third version, noDemo, has 
			no demonstration data and may be the easiest to edit. You might review the 
			<B>Introduction</B> initial worksheet that describes how to use the 
			spreadsheet. There three distributions of the spreadsheet are in the 
			following table.  To edit and save your 
			data, your version of Excel on your computer may require you to click on 
			"Enable Editing" if it says "Protected View" at the top of the screen.

<B>SUMMARY:</B> 
			
This Excel spreadsheet is a planning tool for people who need to plan for future saving and spending needs, want to get rough estimates of their saving and spending patterns, and are willing to enter summaries of their personal data required to compute this.  Final results are show in summary tables and glide-path graphs of those tables. All data is entered  and calculated in this spreadsheet. No data is exported from the spreadsheet. From the data that you enter, the spreadsheet estimates yearly cash-flows using income from various sources: Work,  Pensions, Social Security, Annuities, and Life Insurance benefits;  contributions and withdrawals from tax-deferred IRAs, Roths and Savings investment accounts. It also estimates yearly expenses. It then estimates yearly Federal tax rates and resulting cash-flows. It allows scheduled and irregular contributions and withdrawals for investment accounts (IRA, Roth, Savings) as well as scheduled-and-irregular expenses and deductions. It then estimates investment returns and taxes on investment returns. These are also used in the calculations for estimating yearly net worth. It can be useful for investigating various planning scenarios by making changes and seeing how that affects the results. It will run in a variety of spreadsheet programs such as Windows Excel, OpenOffice or LibreOffice "calc", Google"sheet", etc. since it doesn't use Microsoft Visual Basic because VBA may not be available in all spreadsheet programs. It does not save data on the Internet. Why model? Although all models will be inaccurate, having a rough estimate can be useful for planning purposes. The spreadsheet is a compromise between complexity and completeness and leans in the direction of a simpler model. It is an educational tool. As statistician George Box noted "All models are wrong, but some are useful". In addition, a crude glide-path calculator is available to illustrate the concept that may be useful to experiment with to better understand the concept of glide-path before using the full spreadsheet.


<p>					
<B>STATUS:</B> Cleaned up the Social Security calculation and description to show the delayed claim benefit and the additional CPI added on with SS COLA. Added Cash Rate Of Return (ROR) to SavingsData to better estimate savings portfolios ROR. Added a  "virtual" deductible IRA computed as the asset weighted values for: 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), traditional-IRA, Rollover IRA to computes the average characteristics s for the virtual deductible IRA. Added IRS pub 590-B Single Life Expectancy Table used by lifetime IRA for other than age 70 1/2 RMD. Added Table-GUIs to allow multiple entries for Insurance (in AgeData worksheet), Work history, different types of deductible-IRAs (deductible, inherited-5yr, inherited-lifetime), and Roth-IRAs (non-deductible Roth, inherited-5yr, inherited-lifetime, Roth-401(k)). Improved Results worksheet including new tables, added Glide-Path graphs for some of the tables. Improved and simplified the SimpleCalc including optional Social Security income annuity. Updated the screen shots in the Figures worksheet. Updated documentation throughout including Resources, Glossary and FAQ.
